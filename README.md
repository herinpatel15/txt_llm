# Simple GPT-2 Chatbot üëç
This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot by fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT-2 model on custom conversational data. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch to adapt the GPT-2 model for generating responses in an interactive chat interface.

## Overview
The core idea of the project is to use transfer learning to adjust a GPT-2 model with your own training data. The fine-tuned model learns your conversational style and context, enabling it to provide more relevant responses. Once fine-tuning is complete, the model is used in a simple command-line interface for real-time interaction.

## Key Features
Fine-Tuning: Adapt a pre-trained GPT-2 model on your custom text dataset to align the chatbot‚Äôs responses with your desired conversational style.
Chat Interface: A simple interactive chat application that processes user input and returns generated responses.
Ease of Deployment: Uses popular libraries (Transformers and PyTorch) to simplify the training and deployment process.
